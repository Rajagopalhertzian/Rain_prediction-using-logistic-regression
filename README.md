Logistic Regression (Classification)

Goal: Predict binary or multi-class outcomes.

How it works:

Applies the logistic (sigmoid) function to a linear combination of features to predict probabilities:



P(y=1) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \dots + \beta_nx_n)}}

Uses Maximum Likelihood Estimation to optimize the coefficients.
